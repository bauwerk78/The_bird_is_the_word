# The_bird_is_the_word
Testing of gravity and making things "jump".

Started as a test of making objects "jump" and then fall down with the use of "gravity".
Then i implemented graphics and so on, this is by no means meant as a flappy bird clone since the gravity is much lower then the
original game as far as i can see, should be easily adjusted though if someone feels like it.
